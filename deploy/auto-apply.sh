# This is the box half of "the fleet follows connector releases". The repo half
# is .github/workflows/adopt-connector-release.yml, which opens and merges the
# pin bump after proving the candidate still accepts this node's committed
# config. This script's whole job is to notice that main moved and apply it.
#
# It is PULL-based on purpose. The alternative -- a CI job holding an SSH key
# into this box -- is the write path connector ADR 0068 deliberately removed,
# and putting it back in three repos' secrets is a wider blast radius than the
# tedium it saves. Nothing outside this box can make this box deploy.
#
# It refuses rather than guesses:
#   * a dirty working tree means a human is mid-operation here -- stop, loudly;
#   * only a fast-forward is applied, never a merge or a reset, so a box can
#     never end up on a tree nobody reviewed;
#   * after `up -d` the connector must reach `healthy`, or this exits non-zero
#     so `systemctl status` and the journal show it. A box that comes back
#     unhealthy is also picked up by the connector repo's fleet-health.yml,
#     which opens a needs:human issue;
#   * a render or apply failure is retried, and reported, on every run until
#     it is fixed -- never silently sat on with the box left on the new
#     commit and the old config (TOON_Network#164, porting TOON_Network#160;
#     see `deploy/.applied`, below the fetch, for how).

# `docker compose` itself does with it) -- only a `.env` with no COMPOSE_FILE
